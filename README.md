# My First React Project
Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Demo link: [React Calculator](https://calculator-one-kappa-95.vercel.app/)

I had lots of fun while starting out with this project. I started the project after few weeks of react tutorial via youtube. I had decent javascript skills at the time but not that good at design so you will see that the demo has really a poor choice of colors. I haven't got the time to get back to it yet but it will be updated when I get enough time. Also I have to improve and check the features again and see if it has any issue since I haven't updated the dependencies for quite a time.
